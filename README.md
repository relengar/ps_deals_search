# Playstation deals search

Collects deals from playstation store and provides a semantic search uppon them. There are multiple services that facilitates this.

## Servces

### Crawler

Is a web crawler that will collect the deals from playstation store and dispatch each game to nats. This is supposed to be executed as a periodic job, not to be deplyed as a permanently running service.

- in `./ps_crawler` directory.
- Dependencies
  - [NATS](https://docs.nats.io/)
- Consumed by [ps_ingest](#ingest)

### Ingest

Consumes games from crawler service and serilaizes them to database. Is dispatching synchronous requests to [embedder service](#embedder) to receive text embeddings

- in `./ps_ingest` directory
- Dependencies
  - [NATS](https://docs.nats.io/)
  - [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension
  - [embedder service](#embedder)

### Embedder

Is used to provide embedding inference from a trained model, which it downloads from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) on startup.

- in `./psembedding`
- Dependencies
  - [NATS](https://docs.nats.io/)
- Used by
  - [ingest service](#ingest)

### Browser

An outward user interface to search for games.

- in `./ps_browser`
- Depenedencies
  - [NATS](https://docs.nats.io/)
  - [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) with [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension
  - [embedder service](#embedder)

## Setup

To establish environment variables you can create a `resources/.env` file. See `resources/.env.sample`.

The dependencies can be initialized on local with docker.

```shell
docker compose -f resources/docker-compose.dev.yaml up -d
```

Each service than has it's own setup with it's own `.env` file. It is important to keep the env variables such as tokens in sync. See respective `README.md` files for more info.

### Notes

You can open the pgAdmin on http://localhost:5000.

_To login to pgAdmin see `resources/docker-compose.dev.yaml` for env variables which hold credentials_
_In order to setup pgAdmin on local use `postgres` as host. For credentials see `resources/.env`_

To see logs use (see `resources/docker-compose.dev.yaml` for service names):

```shell
docker compose -f resources/docker-compose.dev.yaml logs -f --tail 250 [service_name]
```

After you're done it's best to stop and cleanup the resources.

```shell
docker compose -f resources/docker-compose.dev.yaml down -v && sudo rm -rf resources/postgres/data
```

Teardown with perserving database state

```shell
docker compose -f resources/docker-compose.dev.yaml down
```

There's not migration mechanism (yet). To update postgres schema see `resources/pg_init.sql`
